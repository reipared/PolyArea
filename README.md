# PolyArea

The provided code performs a probability experiment using a simulated hat containing different colored balls.

The code includes a class called "Hat" that represents the hat. The "Hat" class initializes with a variable number of balls of different colors. The contents of the hat are stored in a list, and the "draw" method allows random drawing of a specified number of balls from the hat.

The "experiment" function takes a hat, the expected number of balls of each color, the number of balls to be drawn, and the number of experiments to be conducted. It performs the experiment by drawing balls from the hat, tracking the frequencies of each color, and checking if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies. The function returns the probability of observing the expected frequencies based on the given number of experiments.

The example usage demonstrates how to create a hat with a specific number of colored balls, define the expected frequencies of certain colors, specify the number of balls to be drawn, and conduct a large number of experiments to calculate the probability of observing the expected frequencies.

Overall, this code provides a way to simulate and analyze probability experiments involving drawing balls from a hat with different colors.
